The simplest thing that you can do to open up the <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a> editor on your Rails project is to just type in
<pre>$ subl .</pre>
on the Rails root directory¹.

A slightly better solution is to create a .sublime-project file in your project root directory, so that you may launch the editor with something like
<pre>$ subl --project my_rails_project.sublime-project</pre>
A question then arises, "How do I exclude useless directories as tmp or log from the project file?"

Answer: just edit the sublime-project file this way:
<pre>{
 "folders":
 [
   {
     "path": ".",
     "folder_exclude_patterns": ["tmp", "log"],
     "file_exclude_patterns": [".tmtags"]
   }
 ]
}</pre>
(and of course you should adapt it to your actual preferences on what to exclude from your project).

Note that you can also specify a <strong>"file_exclude_patterns"</strong> property to filter out some files (in my case I wanted to exclude the ctag index file).
