The brand new release of Firefox 3.6 brings, together with some improvements in the browser, also some headaches for all selenium users: actually the latest selenium RC jar (selenium-server.jar) won't work with Firefox 3.6.

The problem is related to the addons that Selenium will pretend to have in the Firefox instance fired up when Selenium RC server starts. As a matter of fact, those two addons are not declared to be compatible with 3.6.

The simple fix is then to edit the addons' install.rdf files in the selenium-server.jar to manually set the compatibility to 3.6.

Alternatively, you can download <a href="http://github.com/saucelabs/saucelenium/blob/master/selenium-sauce.jar">this patched jar</a> from <a href="http://github.com/saucelabs/saucelenium/">this</a> repository, rename it to selenium-server.jar and replace the previous jar with this.

The actual steps to fix my webrat gem (I use Selenium through Webrat) were
<ol>
	<li>download the above mentioned file (http://github.com/saucelabs/saucelenium/blob/master/selenium-sauce.jar)</li>
	<li>rename it to selenium-server.jar</li>
	<li>replace the previous file in the vendor folder of your webrat gem (mine was /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/webrat-0.7.0/vendor/selenium-server.jar)</li>
</ol>
