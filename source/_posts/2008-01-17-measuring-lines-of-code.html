Mi e' piaciuta molto questa frase di Kent Beck da una mail <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/137842">sulla lista xp americana</a>, sull'uso del numero di linee di codice come metrica di produttivita':
<blockquote><i>Lines of code has many limitations -- it's like measuring a factory based on its consumption of raw materials not on its output.</i></blockquote>
Ricorda un po' <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD854.html">quella </a>di Edsger W.Dijkstra
<blockquote><i>Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process and measure "programmer productivity" in terms of "number of lines of code produced". In so doing they book that number on the wrong side of the ledger: we should always refer to "the number of lines of code spent".</i></blockquote>
