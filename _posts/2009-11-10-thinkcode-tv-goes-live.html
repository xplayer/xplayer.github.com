An advertisement for my friend and mentor Piergiuliano Bossi: his long-waited <a href="http://it.thinkcode.tv/">ThinkCode.TV</a> goes live!

<strong>ThinkCode.TV </strong>is a website specializes in the delivery of high quality commercial screencasts about software development, at a really cheap prices.

The first 5 videos are now online (the actual language is italian, but english content is planned for the following months):
<ul>
	<li>The first two lessions on <strong>Python</strong>, by Marco Beri</li>
	<li>A screencast on <strong>MacRuby</strong>, by Renzo Borgatti</li>
	<li>The first two lessions on <strong>TDD</strong>, by Piergiuliano Bossi.</li>
</ul>
Selling all these high-quality screencasts at about <strong>5 euro each </strong>makes them *really* appetible.
