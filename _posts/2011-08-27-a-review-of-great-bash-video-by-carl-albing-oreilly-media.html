Shell programming is a topic that every professional programmer should care about, and keep improving on, for several reasons.
Here are the first two I can think about:
<ol>
	<li>Because is essential in order to promote the automation of many manual processes (and automation is damn important!).</li>
	<li>Because I like to be a programmer as much as a <a title="what is a devop?" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps" target="_blank">devop</a>, and I want to be able to deploy what I develop, and take care of all the operational and system stuff related to the system I contribute to build.</li>
</ol>
Me myself made the mistake of underestimate the relevance of this topic for way too time in the past: don't make my same mistake :-)

<a title="Carl Albing's &quot;Great Bash&quot; by O'Reilly Media" href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920013334" target="_blank">Carl Albing's "Great Bash" by O'Reilly Media</a> is a collection of several short video lessons on the basics of the shell programming.

I watch the "Great Bash" lessons hoping to learn more about shell programming, but unfortunately Carl Albing's video lessons are too introductory (IMHO).

It was nevertheless great to recap many things I learned here and there, and so my time watching it was not wasted at all, but I would recommend this video only to shell programmer beginners.

There are also some (really) minor defects in the technical way the video is recorded: the audio quality may be improved and sometimes the speaker take some long inexplicable pauses. But, that said, the overall quality is really good.

In the end I recommend to watch this video if you are a shell programmer beginner and you want to start understanding more about this topic.
